### Notes from the Author

This is not the greatest UI design, this is more a showcase of some of the things I can do.

For example the background video could change depending on weather, but it wouldn't demonstrate any more of my abilities, just the fact I thought of it (see what I did there?).

If I had more time I'd work a lot on the UI. It is difficult to see the day forcast, so splitting the days up and using a clock for time and showing the way the weather changes on each day would've been nice.
